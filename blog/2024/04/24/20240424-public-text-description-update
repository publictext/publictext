## Wanted Features of the Ecosystem

- **Plain text**: Using Markdown for simple, flexible content creation and editing. Tags and more complex metadata is stored using an open plaintext protocol.
- **Rich Semantic Syntax**: Using RDF Semantic Edges and Weighted Attributes and Weighted Links/Edges 
- **Compatibility** Plaintext PublicTxt Syntax should be consistent with Obsidian and Obsidian DataView Plugin links and attributes

- **Desktop and Mobile UI**: Accessible interfaces for diverse devices, enhancing user interaction, content discovery and creation, and community engagement.
- **Fluid Community Controls**: Flexibility with public, semi-public, and private content settings.
- **TerminusDb Backend**: Use richly featured, collaboration focused, versioned Graph Database like TerminusDb to store the Knowledge Graph  in memory for faster use of the graph in ecosystem applications
- **Social Bookmarking and Blogging**: A standard for storing MetaWeb (SideWiki like) data about web resources. This to be used with  Interactive platforms for content creation and sharing.
