I am preparing to stop fulltime employment and to start working freelance via the DigitalRhizome worker-owned co-op.
This will go into effect on the 15th of June, 2024. I will still do some contract work for my current employer, but I will be working on the PublicTxt project and the ZomeWorks suite for a large percentage of my time.

Am excited, but also a bit nervous. 

If you need any interesting software dev done, give me a shout.
